<h3><a name="preface" id="preface">PREFACE.</a></h3>

<p>The following Drama was written with a view to Stage
representation, and it is therefore rather as an Acting
Play than as a Dramatic Poem that it should be judged
by its readers.</p>

<p>It follows as closely as possible the striking story
recorded by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in his work,
"De Administratione Imperii." Nor has the writer had
occasion (except in the death of the heroine) to modify
the powerful historical situations and incidents to which
it is right to say his attention was first directed by his
friend the well-known scholar and critic, Mr. W. Watkiss
Lloyd.</p>

<p>The date of the story is circa 970 <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span></p>

<p>Bursts on our bare-swept plains. Upon the South,</p>

<p>My son Asander's youth may prove too weak</p>

<p>The treasure of his age, who now blooms forth</p>
<p>In early maidenhood. The girl is fair</p>

<p>A king in all but name, such reverence</p>
<p>His citizens accord him. Were it not well</p>
<p>The Prince Asander should contract himself</p>
<p>In marriage to this girl, and take the strength</p>

<p>No more of this, I pray. There is no tribe</p>
<p>Of all the blighting locust swarms of war,</p>
<p>Which sweep our wasted fields, I would not rather</p>
<p>Take to my heart and cherish than these vipers.</p>
<p>Dost thou forget, my lord, how of old time,</p>
<p>In the brave days of good Sauromatus,</p>
<p>These venomous townsmen, shamelessly allied</p>
<p>With the barbarian hosts, brought us to ruin;</p>
<p>Or, with the failing force of C&aelig;sar leagued,</p>

<p>I would rather see our loved State sunk and lost,</p>
<p>Than know my boy, the sole heir of my crown,</p>
<p>The sole hope of my people, taken and noosed</p>

<p>From my first youth&mdash;who saw my father slain,</p>
<p>Not in fair fight, pierced through by honest steel,</p>
<p>But unawares, struck by some villanous engine,</p>
<p>Which, armed with inextinguishable fire,</p>
<p>Flew hissing from the walls and slew at once</p>
<p>Coward and brave alike; I, whose young brother,</p>

<p>The stripling who to me was as a son,</p>
<p>Taken in some sally, languished till he died,</p>

<p>There is no cloud of care I yet have known&mdash;</p>
<p>And I am now a man, and have my cares&mdash;</p>
<p>Which the fresh breath of morn, the hungry chase,</p>
<p>The echoing horn, the jocund choir of tongues,</p>
<p>Or joy of some bold enterprise of war,</p>
<p>When the swift squadrons smite the echoing plains,</p>
<p>Scattering the stubborn spearmen, may not break,</p>

<p>One day I needs must wed, though love I shall not.</p>
<p>And if it were indeed to serve the State,</p>
<p>Nay, if 'twould smooth one wrinkle from thy brow,</p>
<p>Why, it might be to-morrow. Tell me, father,</p>
<p>Who is this paragon that thou designest</p>
<p>Shall call me husband? Some barbarian damsel</p>
<p>Reared on mare's milk, and nurtured in a tent</p>
<p>In Scythia? Well, 'twere better than to mate</p>
<p>With some great lady from the Imperial Court,</p>

<p><i>Ambas.</i> Sirs, I bring you a message from Lamachus,
the Archon of Cherson.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> Sirs, forsooth! Know ye not the dignity of
princes, or does your republican rudeness bar you from
all courtesy? I do not count myself equal to the King,
nor, therefore, should you.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Nay, good Lysimachus, let him proceed.</p>

<p><i>Ambas.</i> If I am blunt of speech, I beg your forgiveness.
I bring to you a letter from the citizen Lamachus,
which I shall read, if it be your pleasure.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Read on.</p>

<p><i>Ambas.</i> "To the King of Bosphorus, Lamachus sends

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>

greeting. We are both old. Let us forget the former
enmities of our States, and make an alliance which shall
protect us against the storm of barbarian invasion which
C&aelig;sar is too weak to ward off. Thou hast a son, and I
a daughter. Thy son is, from all report, a brave youth
and worthy. My daughter is the paragon of her sex. I
have wealth and possessions and respect as great as if
I were a sceptred King. The youth and the maid are
of fitting age. Let us join their hands together, and with
them those of our States, and grow strong enough to
defy the barbarians, and Rome also."</p>

<p><i>Asan.</i> My liege, I am willing for this marriage. Let it be.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> My son, we have not yet heard all. Read on, sir.</p>

but the jealousy of our people enforces, viz. that the
Prince Asander, if he weds my daughter, shall thenceforth

forswear his country, nor seek to return to it on pain

more than their lives."</p>

<p class="entrance"><span class="charname">Megacles</span> <i>and</i> Courtiers.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Well, my lords, and so it is all settled. We
must all be on board in half an hour. His Altitude the
Prince sails at once for Cherson, and with a view to his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>

immediate marriage. Was ever such a rash step heard
of? Not twenty-four hours to get ready the marriage
equipment of a Prince of Bosphorus. Well, well, I dare
say they would be glad enough to take him with no rag
to his back. I dare say these rascally republicans would
know no better if he were to be married in his everyday suit.</p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> I' faith, I should never have dreamt it.
Asander, who is the boldest huntsman and the bravest
soldier, and the best of good fellows, to go and tie himself
to the apron-strings of a Greek girl, a tradesman's
daughter from Cherson, of all places on earth! Pah! it
makes me sick!</p>

<p><i>2nd Court.</i> But I hear she is beautiful as Artemis,
and&mdash;&mdash;Well, we are all young or have been, and beauty
is a strong loadstone to such metal as the Prince's.</p>

<p><i>3rd Court.</i> Nay, he has never set eyes on her; and,
for that matter, the Lady Irene was handsome enough in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>

all conscience, and a jovial young gentlewoman to boot.
Ye gods! do you mind how she sighed for him and
pursued him? It was a sight to please the goddess Aphrodite
herself. But then, our good Asander, who had only
to lift up his little finger, was so cold and positively
forbidding, that I once came upon the poor lady crying
her eyes out in a passion of mortified feeling.</p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> Ay, she was from this outlandish Cherson,
was not she? Aphrodite was a Greek woman also,
remember.</p>

<p><i>2nd Court.</i> So she was. I had quite forgotten where
the lady came from. Well, if she is there now, and
cannot get her Prince, and would like a gay, tolerably
well-favoured young fellow for a lover, I suppose she
need go no further than the present company.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> My lords, I pray you leave these frivolities,
and let us come to serious matters. Think, I beg you,
in what a painful position I am placed. I am to go,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>

without proper notice, as Master of the Ceremonies of
the Court of Bosphorus, to conduct an important Court-ceremonial
with a pack of scurvy knaves, who, I will be
bound, hardly know the difference between an Illustrious
and a Respectable, or a Respectable and an Honourable.
I must do my best to arrange all decently and in order,
and as near as may be to the Imperial model, and all
these matters I have to devise on shipboard, tossed
about on that villanous Euxine, with a smell of pitch
everywhere, and sea-sickness in my stomach. And when
I get to Cherson, if ever I do get there alive, I have not
the faintest idea whom I am to consult with&mdash;whether
there is a Count of the Palace or anybody, in fact. I
dare say there is nobody; I am sure there is nobody.
A marriage of the heir apparent is a very serious affair,
let me tell you. What a comfort it is that I have got
the last edition of that precious work of the divine
Theodosius on Dignities! If it were not for that, I
should go mad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> My good Megacles, I warn you the Prince
cares as little for etiquette as he does for love-making.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Very likely, and that makes my position so
difficult. Just reflect for a moment. When we go
ashore at Cherson, I suppose we shall be received by
the authorities?</p>

<p><i>2nd Court.</i> Surely, good Megacles.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Then, how many steps should Prince Asander
take to meet his father-in-law Lamachus&mdash;eh? And
how many steps should Lamachus take? You never
gave the matter a thought? Of course not. And these
are questions to be settled on the spot, and scores like them.</p>

<p><i>3rd Court.</i> I dare say it won't matter at all, or very little.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Matter very little, indeed! very little, forsooth!
Why, in the name of all the saints, do not alliances fall
through for less? Are not bloody wars fought for less?

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>

Do I not remember the sad plight of the Grand Chamberlain,
when the Illustrious Leo, the Pro-Consul of Macedonia,
had a meeting at Court with the Respectable the
Vice-Prefect of Pannonia? Now, the Pro-Consul should
have taken four steps forward, as being the most noble,
the Vice-Prefect five. But, the Vice-Prefect being a tall
man, and the Pro-Consul a short one, the Grand Chamberlain
did not sufficiently measure their distances; and so
when they had taken but four steps each, there were the
two Dignitaries bolt upright, face to face, glaring at each
other, and no room to take the fraction of a foot pace more.</p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> Faith, a very laughable situation, good
Megacles. Was it hard to settle?</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> I should think it was hard to settle. No one
could interfere; the Book of Ceremonies was sent for,
and was silent. There was nothing for it but that the
Emperor, after half an hour, broke up the Court in confusion,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>

and those two remained where they were till it was
quite dark, and then they got away, no one knows how.
But what came of it? For fifteen years there was war
and bloodshed between the provinces, and but for the
invasion of the Goths, there would be to this day.
Matter little, indeed! Why, you foolish youngster, ceremony
is everything in life. To understand Precedence
aright is to know the secrets of nature. The order of
Precedence is the order of Creation. It is, in fact, a
very cosmogony. Oh, a noble science! a noble science!</p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> Right, good Megacles, to magnify your
office. Bravery is nothing; goodness is nothing;
beauty is a foolish dream. Give us Ceremony, Ceremony,
more Ceremony; it is the salt of life.</p>

this place improves on acquaintance, after all. Poor, of

is fair&mdash;as fair, indeed, as if she was the Emperor's
daughter. She is a beautiful creature, truly. But give <i>me</i>
that delightful lady-in-waiting of hers, the Lady Melissa.
What grace! what rounded proportions! I like mature
beauty. She is as like the late divine Empress as two
peas, and I thought&mdash;I dare say I was wrong, but I
really thought&mdash;I made an impression. Poor things!
poor things! They can't help themselves. We courtiers
really ought to be very careful not to abuse our power.
It is positive cruelty. The contest is too unequal. It
makes one inclined sometimes to put on the manners of
a clown, so as to give them a chance. Nay, nay, you

enchanted (<i>bows again; then takes several steps to the right,

fortune! Ever since I had the honour to see you just
now, I have only lived in the hope of seeing you again.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> (<i>curtsying</i>). Oh, my lord, you great courtiers can
find little to interest you in our poor little Court and its
humble surroundings.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Madam, I beg! not a word! I was just thinking
that you exactly resembled the late divine Empress.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Oh, my lord, forbear! The Empress! and I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>

have never been out of Cherson! You flatter me,
you flatter me, indeed. That is the way with all you
courtiers from Constantinople. Now, if you had said
that my Lady Gycia was beautiful&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> My dear lady, I do not admire her in the least.
She has no manners, really&mdash;nothing, at any rate, to
attract a man of the great world; a mere undeveloped
girl, with all the passion to come. No, no, my good
lady, give me a woman who has lived. We courtiers
know manners and breeding when we see them, and
yours are simply perfect, not to say Imperial.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> What a magnificent nature! Well, to say the
truth, the Lady Gycia is not at all to my taste. It is a
cold, insipid style of beauty, at the best; and she is as
self-willed and as straitlaced as a lady abbess. I suppose
she is well matched with the Prince Asander?</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Well, he is a handsome lad enough, and virtuous,
but weak, as youth always is, and pliable. Now, for

myself, I am happy to say I am steadfast and firm as a rock.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Ah, my lord, if all women saw with my eyes,
there would not be such a run after youth. Give me a
mature man, who has seen the world and knows something
of life and manners.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> What an intelligent creature! Madam, your
sentiments do you credit. I beg leave to lay at your
feet the assurance of my entire devotion.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Oh, my lord, you are too good! Why, what a
dear, condescending creature!&mdash;the manners of a Grand
Chamberlain and the features of an Apollo!</p>

there. If it were not for that delightful Lady Melissa,
whose humble slave I am always (Courtiers <i>laugh</i>), I
would give all I am worth to turn my back upon this
scurvy city and its republican crew. But my Lord
Asander is so devoted to his fair lady&mdash;and, indeed, I
can hardly wonder at it&mdash;that there seems no hope of our
seeing the old shores again. I thought he would have

to a rich and beautiful woman. I think I could be as
steady as a rock under the like conditions.</p>

<p><i>3rd Court.</i> Well, mind ye, it is not every man who
could treat the very marked overtures of the fair Lady
Irene as he did. And he had not seen his wife then,
either. No; the man is a curious mixture, somewhat
cold, and altogether constant, and that is not a bad combination
to keep a man straight with the sex. Poor soul!
do you remember how she pursued him at Bosphorus,
and how she fainted away at the wedding? They
say she is coming back speedily, in her right mind.
She has been away ever since, no one knows where.
That solemn brother of hers conveyed her away privily.</p>

King and a new Queen, and we shall leave this dog-hole
and live at home like gentlemen once more.</p>

be a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> My lords, what have you to report? Have the men arrived?</p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> For a week past they have been arriving at
the rate of fifty a day. The ships anchor in due course.
At dead of night, when everything is still, the merchandise
is landed and conveyed well disguised to the great storehouses
of Lamachus' palace, with good store of arms and provisions.</p>

<p><i>2nd Court.</i> Yes, and by the day of the festival we
shall have more than five hundred well-armed men within
the walls, who, while the people are feasting, will bear
down all opposing forces and open the gates to the larger
body, who will lie concealed in the grain-ships in the harbour.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> Does no one suspect, think you, as yet?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> Not a soul. The merchandise is landed at
dead of night.</p>

<p><i>3rd Court.</i> Does the Prince know?</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> Not yet, not a word. I can't trust him with his
blind love for his wife.</p>

<p><i>3rd Court.</i> What if he will not be of us?</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> Then he shall be put under hatches at once for
Bosphorus, and may take his wife with him if he pleases.</p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> But will he pardon the deed?</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> The lad is a good lad enough, but weak as
water. The world always pardons successful enterprises.
Besides, I am in great hopes that he has so quarrelled
with the ruler of Cherson, and may be, moreover, so out of
conceit with his wife, that we can do as we will with him.</p>

<p><i>2nd Court.</i> But be prudent, my Lord Lysimachus, I
beg, for we know not how far he is with us, and if he is
against us now, it may take more than we know to keep
our heads on our shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> My lords, you shall not lose a drop of your
blood. But here is my Lord Asander. He looks cast
down enough, in all conscience.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">Asander</span>.</p>

<p>Well, Prince, hast thou seen the lady?</p>

<p><i>Asan.</i> Speak not to me of her, I pray. I must leave
this accursed place at once and for ever, and must take
my wife with me. Once in Bosphorus, I may know again
the happiness which is denied me here. I will not stay
here a day. Is there any ship from Bosphorus in
harbour? Get me away to-night secretly, and the Lady
Gycia with me.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> My lord, there are many ships here from Bosphorus,
but none empty or which can be spared now; but
it wants but two days to the festival, and if thou wilt tarry
until then, it may be we can so arrange that either thou
mayst set sail for Bosphorus at your will or bring
Bosphorus hither at will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p><i>Asan.</i> What do these words mean? You speak in
riddles. I care not what becomes of me, but remember
my honour, Lysimachus, my honour! If any scheme
against the State of Cherson is in your mind, I will have
none of it. I want nothing of these people, only to be
allowed to turn my back upon them and their intrigues
for ever, and to carry the wife whom I love far away from
the air of chicane and base deceit which makes this
Cherson a hell.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><i>Lys.</i> My Lord Asander, thou hast not forgot</p>
<p>Thy oath which thou didst swear ere first you left</p>
<p>Our Bosphorus, that, come what fate should come,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst not forget her. Now, as Fate would have it,</p>
<p>These gentlemen and I, hearing report</p>
<p>Of the grand festival which now approaches,</p>
<p>Have ta'en such measures as may make our city</p>
<p>Mistress of this her rival. Day by day</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>Ships laden deep with merchandise cast anchor</p>
<p>By Lamachus's palace, and unload</p>
<p>At dead of night their tale of arm&#232;d men,</p>
<p>And by to-morrow night, which is the eve</p>
<p>Of the feast, five hundred men-at-arms or more</p>
<p>Will there lie hid. These, when the festival</p>
<p>Has spent itself, and the drowsed citizens,</p>
<p>Heavy with meat and wine, are fast asleep,</p>
<p>Will issue forth at midnight and will seize</p>
<p>The guardians of the gates, and throw them open</p>
<p>To an o'erwhelmmg force which fills the ships</p>
<p>Which lie within the harbour. For the rest,</p>
<p>Cherson is ours, thou free to go or stay,</p>
<p>King if thou wilt; but this, my lord, know well&mdash;</p>
<p>If thou hast even no reverence for thy oath,</p>
<p>No power on earth can free thee from thy bonds</p>
<p>Or speed thee hence, if still this curs&#232;d State</p>
<p>Keeps its free power. Therefore, look well to it.</p>

<p>And hug discretion. But, indeed, my lord,</p>
<p>We have gone too far to pause, and if thou like not</p>
<p>Our scheme, which makes for thee and for our State,</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> Well, good Megacles, I hope you are prepared
to carry out your function. It will be a busy and
anxious day to-morrow, no doubt, and most of us will
be glad when midnight strikes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>

<i>Meg.</i> My Lord Lysimachus, I hope so. I have not
closed an eye for the last two nights. As to the Procession,
I flatter myself that no better-arranged pomp
has ever defiled before C&aelig;sar's Palace. It will be long,
it will be splendid, it will be properly marshalled. There
is no other man in the Empire who knows the distinctions
of rank or the mysteries of marshalling better than
I do. Look at the books I have studied. There is the
treatise of the Learned and Respectable Symmachus on
Processions. That is one. There is the late divine
Emperor Theodosius on Dignities and Titles of Honour.
That is two. There is our learned and illustrious Chamberlain
Procopius's treatise on the office and duties of
a Count of the Palace. That, as no doubt you know,
is in six large volumes. That is three, or, nay, eight
volumes. Oh, my poor head! And I have said nothing
of the authorities on Costume&mdash;a library, I assure you,
in themselves. Yes, it has been an anxious time, but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>

a very happy one. I wish our young friends here would
devote a little more time to such serious topics, and less
to such frivolities as fighting and making love. The
latter is a fine art, no doubt, and, when done according
to rule, is well enough; but as for fighting, getting oneself
grimed with dust and sweat, and very likely some vulgar
churl's common blood to boot&mdash;pah! it is intolerable to
think of it.</p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> Well, good Megacles, I am afraid that the
world cannot spare its soldiers yet for many years to
come. So long as there is evil in the world, and lust
of power and savagery and barbarism, so long, depend
upon it, there is room and need for the soldier.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Certainly, my lord, certainly; and besides, they
are very highly decorative too. Nothing looks better to
my mind at a banquet than bright gay faces and lithe
young figures set in a shining framework of mail. By
the way, my Lord Lysimachus, it was kind of you to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>

provide our procession with a strong detachment of fine
young soldiers from Bosphorus. I have secured a prominent
place for them, and the effect will be perfect.
I trust the Lady Melissa will like it.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> My lord, you are mistaken; there are no soldiers
from Bosphorus here.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> But I was with the Prince last night, and saw them.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> I tell you you are mistaken. There are none
here. Do you understand me? There are none here.</p>

<p><i>2nd Court.</i> Nay, indeed, my Lord Megacles. We
were trying, with a view to the pageant, how a number
of young men of Cherson would look in the array of
Bosphorus; but we gave it up, since we feared that they
would bear them so clumsily that they would mar the whole effect.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Ah, that explains it; quite right, quite right.
Well, I see I was mistaken. But I wish I could have

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>

had soldiers from Bosphorus. They are the one thing
wanting to make to-morrow a perfect success, as the
Lady Melissa said.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> They are indeed, as you say. But, my Lord
Megacles, pray do not whisper abroad what you have
said here; these people are so jealous. They would grow
sullen, and spoil the pageant altogether.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Ah, my lord, you have a good head. I will not
breathe a word of it till the day is done.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> Thanks, my lord, and as I know you will be
weary with the long day's work and your great anxieties,
I am going to lay a little friendly compulsion upon you.
You must leave the banquet to-morrow and go to rest
by eleven o'clock at latest.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Well, my lord, I am not so young as I was, and
if I have your permission to leave before all is over, well
and good. No one knows what an anxious day is before
me, and I have no doubt I shall have earned my night's

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>

rest by then. But I have much yet to do, so with

<p><i>Meg.</i> Oh, this has been a happy day. All has gone
admirably. Not a hitch in all the arrangements.
Precedence kept, rank observed, dresses all they
should be. I do not, I really do not think, though I
say it who should not, that the Imperial Chamberlain
at Constantinople could have conducted the matter better.</p>

<p><i>1st Court.</i> Nay, that he could not, good Megacles.
Let us hope that what remains to do will go as smoothly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> What remains? Doubtless you mean the
banquet. That is all arranged long ago under three
heads. First, the order of entering the hall; second,
the order of the seats; third, the order of going forth.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> Doubtless the last will arrange itself. Remember,
the only order of going to be observed is this, that thou
get thyself gone, and all the guests from Cherson gone,
fully half an hour before midnight.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> But, my lord, that is impossible; you ask too
much. How long do you suppose it will take, at a
moderate computation, to get one hundred men of ill-defined
rank out of a room with a decent regard for
Precedence. Why, I have seen it take an hour at the
Palace, where everybody knew his place, and here I
cannot undertake to do it under two.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> My friend, you will get it done; you will waive
ceremony. None but the Prince and ourselves must

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>

remain within half an hour of midnight, and the hall
must be cleared.</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Ah, well, my Lord Lysimachus, the responsibility
rests with you; I will have none of it. It is as much as
my reputation is worth. But if I do this, cannot you let
me have a guard of honour of armed men to stand at
intervals along the hall. I have been longing for them all day.</p>

<p><i>Lys.</i> (<i>angrily</i>). Peace, fool! I have told you before
we have no soldiers here.</p>

<p class="right">[People <i>of Cherson overhearing him</i>.</p>

<p><i>1st Cit.</i> Didst hear that old man? He believes there
are soldiers here. Whence do they come? and why did
the other check him?</p>

<p><i>Meg.</i> Well, my Lord Lysimachus, if not soldiers, men-at-arms,
and these there certainly are, and highly decorative too.</p>

<p><i>2nd Cit.</i> I hate these Bosphorians. What if the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>

rumour should be true? Pass the word to the citizens
that they sleep not to-night, but keep their arms ready for
what may come. We are a match for them, whatever
may be their design. To-morrow we will probe this
matter to its depths.</p>

<p><i>2nd Court.</i> Depend upon it, there is no time to lose if
we would forestall these fellows. But here comes the
procession to the banqueting-hall.</p>

<p><i>1st Lab.</i> Well, friend, what kind of day has it been
with you?</p>

<p><i>2nd Lab.</i> Oh, a white day, a happy day! Plenty of
food, plenty of wine, raree shows without end, such processions
as were never seen&mdash;the very model of a
democracy; nothing to pay, and everybody made happy

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>

at the expense of the State. I have lived in Cherson,
man and boy, for fifty years, and I never saw anything to
compare with it. Here's good luck to Lamachus's
memory, say I, and I should like to celebrate his
lamented decease as often as his daughter likes.</p>

<p><i>1st Lab.</i> Didst know him, citizen?</p>

<p><i>2nd Lab.</i> No, not I. He has been dead these two
years. Time he was forgotten, I should think. They
don't commemorate poor folk with all these fal-lals and follies.</p>

<p><i>1st Lab.</i> Well, citizen, there is one comfort&mdash;the
great people don't enjoy themselves as we do. Did you
ever see such a set of melancholy, frowning, anxious
faces as the grandees carried with them to-day? And as
for the Prince and the Lady Gycia, I don't believe they
spoke a word the livelong day, though they walked
together. That is the way with these grandees. When
you and I quarrel with our wives, it is hammer and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>

tongs for five minutes, and then kiss and make friends.</p>

<p><i>2nd Lab.</i> And fancy being drilled by that old fool
from Bosphorus&mdash;"Most Illustrious, this is your proper
place;" "Respectable sir, get you back there" (<i>mimics</i>
<span class="charname">Megacles</span>), and so forth.</p>

<p><i>1st Lab.</i> Well, well, it is good to be content. But I
warrant we are the only two unhappy creatures in
Cherson to-night, who have the ill fortune to be sober.
And such wine too, and nothing to pay!</p>

<p><i>2nd Lab.</i> Never mind, citizen, we shall be paid in
meal or malt, I dare say, and we are bound to keep sober.
By the way, it is a curiously contrived bonfire this.</p>

<p><i>1st Lab.</i> It will be the crowning triumph of the whole
festival, the senator said.</p>

<p><i>2nd Lab.</i> But who ever heard of a bonfire on a large
scale like this, so close to an old building? You know
our orders: we are to place lines of faggots and straw

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>

close to the building on every side, well soaked with oil,
and certain sealed vessels full of a secret compound in
the midst of them. And just before midnight we are to
run with torches and set light to the whole bonfire, to
amuse the noble guests at the banquet.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="charname">Irene</span> <i>at a window, overhearing.</i></p>

<p><i>1st Lab.</i> Ah! do you not see? It is a device of the
Senate to startle our friends from Bosphorus. The
faggots and straw blaze up fiercely round the wall; then,
when all is confusion, the substance in the sealed vessels
escapes and at once puts out the fire, and the laugh is
with us. Our friends from Bosphorus know what we can
do in chemistry before now.</p>

<p><i>2nd Lab.</i> Faith, a right merry device! Ha! ha! What
a head thou hast, citizen! Well, we must go on with our

<p>Beams on our days again, my worthless life</p>
<p>Grows precious, and I tremble like a coward</p>

<p>Though I am true in love, wouldst thou forgive me</p>
<p>If I were false or seemed false to thy State?</p>

<h3>LEWIS MORRIS.</h3>

<hr />

<h3>SONGS OF TWO WORLDS.</h3>

<p>These poems were originally published in three volumes,
issued in the years 1872, 1874, and 1875. The following
are a few selections from the Press notices which
appeared as they were issued.</p>

<p class="center smallcaps">first series.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"No one, after reading the first two poems&mdash;almost perfect in
rhythm and all the graceful reserve of true lyrical strength&mdash;could
doubt for an instant that this book is the result of
lengthened thought and assiduous training in poetic forms.
These poems will assuredly take high rank among the class to
which they belong."&mdash;<i>British Quarterly Review</i>, April, 1872.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"If this volume is the mere prelude of a mind growing in
power, we have in it the promise of a fine poet.... In 'The
Wandering Soul,' the verse describing Socrates has that highest
note of critical poetry, that in it epigram becomes vivid with life,
and life reveals its inherent paradox. It would be difficult to
describe the famous irony of Socrates in more poetical and more
accurate words than by saying that he doubted men's doubts
away."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, February 17th, 1872.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In all this poetry there is a purity and delicacy of feeling
which comes over one like morning air."&mdash;<i>Graphic</i>, March 16th,
1872.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">4</span></p>

<p class="center smallcaps">second series.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In earnestness, sweetness, and the gift of depicting nature,
the writer may be pronounced a worthy disciple of his compatriot,
Henry Vaughan, the Silurist. Several of the shorter poems are
instinct with a noble purpose and a high ideal of life. One
perfect picture, marginally annotated, so to speak, in the speculations
which it calls forth, is 'The Organ-Boy.' But the most
noteworthy poem is the 'Ode on a Fair Spring Morning,' which
has somewhat of the charm and truth to nature of 'L'Allegro'
and 'Il Penseroso.' It is the nearest approach to a master-piece
in the volume."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i>, May 30th, 1874.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"This volume is a real advance on its predecessor of the same
name, and contains at least one poem of great originality, as well
as many of much tenderness, sweetness, and beauty. 'The
Organ-Boy' we have read again and again, with fresh pleasure
on every reading. It is as exquisite a little poem as we have
read for many a day."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, June 13th, 1874.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The reception of the New Writer's first series shows that, in
his degree, he is one of the poetical forces of the time. Of the
school of poetry of which Horace is the highest master, he is a
not undistinguished pupil."&mdash;<i>Academy</i>, August 11th, 1874.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The verses are full of melodious charm, and sing themselves
almost without music."&mdash;<i>Blackwood's</i>, August 1st, 1874.</p>

<p class="center smallcaps">third series.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Not unworthy of its predecessors. It presents the same
command of metre and diction, the same contrasts of mood, the
same grace and sweetness. It cannot be denied that he has won
a definite position among contemporary poets."&mdash;<i>Times</i>, October
16th, 1875.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"'Evensong' shows power thought, and courage to grapple
with the profoundest problems. In the 'Ode to Free Rome'

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5a" id="Page_5a">5</a></span>

we find worthy treatment of the subject and passionate expression
of generous sympathy."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i>, July 31st, 1875.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"More perfect in execution than either of its predecessors....
The pure lyrics are sweeter and richer. In the 'Birth
of Verse' every stanza is a little poem in itself, and yet a part of
a perfect whole."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, May 22nd, 1875.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"If each book that he publishes is to mark as steady improvement
as have his second and third, the world may surely look
for something from the writer which shall immortalize him and
remain as a treasure to literature."&mdash;<i>Graphic</i>, June 1st, 1875.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Fresh, picturesque, and by no means deficient in intensity; but
the most conspicuous merits of the author are the judgment and
moderation with which his poem is designed, his self-possession
within his prescribed limits, and the unfailing elegance of his
composition, which shrinks from obscurity, exuberance, and rash
or painful effort as religiously as many recent poets seem to
cultivate such interesting blemishes.... Perhaps the fine
bursts of music in Marsyas, and the varied emotions portrayed in
Andromeda, are less characteristic of the author than the prompt,
yet graceful, manner in which he passes from one figure to another....
Fourteen of these pieces written in blank verse which
bears comparison with the very best models make up a thoroughly
enjoyable little volume...."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, March 10th,
1876.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[*]</span></a>Book II. was issued as a separate volume prior to the publication of
Books I. and III. and of the complete work.</p></div>

<p class="blockquot">"It is natural that the favourable reception given to his 'Songs
of Two Worlds' should have led the author to continue his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6a" id="Page_6a">6</a></span>

poetical exercises, and it is, no doubt, a true instinct which has led him to tread the classic paths of song. In his choice of subject
he has not shrunk from venturing on ground occupied by at least
two Victorian poets. In neither case need he shrink from comparison.
His Marsyas is full of fine fancy and vivid description.
His Andromeda has to us one recommendation denied to
Kingsley's&mdash;a more congenial metre; another is its unstrained
and natural narrative."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i>, May 20th, 1876.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In his enterprise of connecting the Greek myth with the
high and wider meaning which Christian sentiment naturally
finds for it, his success has been great. The passage in which
Apollo's victory over Marsyas and its effect are described is full
of exquisite beauty. It is almost as fine as verse on such a
subject could be.... The little volume is delightful reading.
From the first line to the last, the high and delicate aroma of
purity breathes through the various spiritual fables."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, May 27th, 1876.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The blank verse is stately, yet sweet, free, graceful, and never
undignified. We confidently believe that our readers will agree
with us in regarding this as one of the finest and most suggestive
poems recently published. We trust to have, ere long,
more poetic work from his hand."&mdash;<i>British Quarterly Review</i>,
April 1st, 1876.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The writer has shown himself more critical than his friends,
and the result is a gradual, steady progress in power, which we
frankly acknowledge.... This long passage studded with
graces."&mdash;<i>Academy</i>, April 29th, 1876.</p>

<h5><i>BOOKS I. and III. and the COMPLETE WORK.</i></h5>

<p class="blockquot">"In one sense the idea of his Epic is not only ambitious,
but audacious, for it necessarily awakens reminiscences of Dante.
Not unfrequently he is charmingly pathetic, as in his Helen and
Psyche. There is considerable force and no small imagination

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7a" id="Page_7a">7</a></span>

in the description of some of the tortures in the 'Tartarus.'
There is genuine poetical feeling in the 'Olympus.'... We
might invite attention to many other passages. But it is more
easy to give honest general praise than to single out particular
extracts."&mdash;<i>Times</i>, February 9th, 1877.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The whole of this last portion of the poem is exceedingly
beautiful.... Nor will any, except critics of limited view,
fail to recognize in the Epic a distinct addition to their store of
those companions of whom we never grow tired."&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
March 3rd, 1877.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"We believe that the Epic will approve itself to students as
one of the most considerable and original feats of recent English
poetry."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i>, March 31st, 1877.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Thought, fancy, music, and penetrating sympathy we have
here, and that radiant, unnamable suggestive delicacy which
enhances the attraction with each new reading."&mdash;<i>British Quarterly
Review</i>, April, 1877.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The present work is by far his greatest achievement; the
whole tone of it is noble, and portions, more especially the concluding
lines, are excessively beautiful."&mdash;<i>Westminster Review</i>, April, 1877.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The work is one of which any singer might justly be proud.
In fact, the Epic is in every way a remarkable poem, which to
be appreciated must not only be read, but studied."&mdash;<i>Graphic</i>,
March 10th, 1877.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"We do not hesitate to advance it as our opinion that 'The
Epic of Hades' will enjoy the privilege of being classed amongst
the poems in the English language which will live."&mdash;<i>Civil
Service Gazette</i>, March 17th, 1877.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Exquisite beauty of melodious verse.... A remarkable
poem, both in conception and execution. We sincerely wish
for the author a complete literary success."&mdash;<i>Literary World</i>,
March 30th, 1877.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8a" id="Page_8a">8</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Will live as a poem of permanent power and charm. It will
receive high appreciation from all who can enter into its meaning,
for its graphic and liquid pictures of external beauty, the depth
and truth of its purgatorial ideas, and the ardour, tenderness,
and exaltation of its spiritual life."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, May 5th, 1877.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have lately been reading a poem which has interested me
very much, a poem called 'The Epic of Hades.' Many of you
may never have heard of it; most of you may never have seen
it. It is, as I view it, another gem added to the wealth of the
poetry of our language."&mdash;<i>Mr. Bright's speech on Cobden, at
Bradford</i>, July 25th, 1877.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In the blank verse of the 'Epic of Hades,' apt words are so
simply arranged with unbroken melody, that if the work were
printed as prose, it would remain a song, and every word would
still be where the sense required it; not one is set in a wrong
place through stress of need for a mechanical help to the music.
The poem has its sound mind housed in a sound body."&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Professor
Morley</span> <i>in the Nineteenth Century</i>, February, 1878.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have read the 'Epic of Hades,' and find it truly charming.
Its pictures will long remain with me, and the music of its
words."&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Oliver Wendell Holmes</span>, April, 1884.</p>

<h3>THE EPIC OF HADES.</h3>

<h5><i>ILLUSTRATED QUARTO EDITION.</i></h5>

<p class="blockquot">"Of Mr. Chapman's illustrations it is pleasant to be able to
speak with considerable admiration, not only because they are
a fortunate echo of the verse, and represent the feelings and
incidents of the 'Epic,' but because of their intrinsic merits.
There is in them a fine and high inspiration of an indefinite
sort."&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, March 29th, 1879.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9a" id="Page_9a">9</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"'The Epic of Hades' is certainly one of the most remarkable
works of the latter half of the nineteenth century. Here is an
<i>&#233;dition de luxe</i> which may possibly tempt the unthinking to
search for the jewel within the casket."&mdash;<i>World</i>, February
12th, 1879.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The exquisite a&#235;rial feeling of 'Eros and Psyche,'&mdash;by far
the best of the drawings,&mdash;in which the figures seem literally to
float in ether. 'Laocoon' is grand and dignified, and all deserve
to be noticed with attention."&mdash;<i>Graphic</i>, January 25th, 1879.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"These designs of themselves would be of the highest value,
and when they are placed, as in this book, by way of illustration
of a text which is full of power, their value is not easily
estimated. The book ought to be one of the most cherished
gifts that any lover of poetry or the pencil could desire."&mdash;<i>Scotsman</i>, January 23rd, 1879.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The author has been most fortunate in his illustrator. The
designs are gems of drawing and conception, and the mezzotint
is admirably adapted to the style of drawing and subject. This
is truly a charming addition to the literary table. It is seldom
one sees figure illustrations of such graceful and powerful beauty,
and so thoroughly in sympathy with the visionary subjects of the
author."&mdash;<i>Art Journal</i>, April, 1879.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"'The Epic of Hades' has already won a place among the
immortals. The lovely and terrible figures of the Greek
mythology have never received a more exquisite consecration
than at the hands of the author, who, with the true divination of
the poet, has known how to interpret in the modern spirit the
profound and pathetic fables of antiquity without vulgarizing by
modern affectations their divine simplicity. This beautiful poem
appears now in an <i>&#233;dition de luxe</i>&mdash;a setting not unworthy of
such gems. The designs are noteworthy for their tenderness
of sentiment and their languid grace."&mdash;<i>Daily News</i>, April
2nd, 1879.</p>

<h3>GWEN:</h3>

<h5><i>A DRAMA IN MONOLOGUE.</i></h5>

<p class="blockquot">"The charm of this beautiful little poem is its perfect simplicity
of utterance; its chastened and exquisite grace. There
is nothing very new in the incidents or in the characters of this
most touching story, except in its unconventional ending, which
takes the reader by surprise. The genius of the author has
closed an idyll of love and death with a strain of sweet, sad
music in that minor key which belongs to remembrance and
regret."&mdash;<i>Daily News</i>, January 22nd, 1879.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"We have read this new work with the interest arising from
the expectations which the author had quickened in us, and with
the hope of finding those expectations confirmed. We are not
disappointed, for we have here the same selectness of language,
the same high, pure tone, the same delicate power of touching
the deeper chords of thought and feeling, which have previously
won our attention and sympathy."&mdash;<i>Literary World</i>, January
17th, 1879.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"At the close of the tale the heart swells with pathos, and the
tears all but force their way into the eyes. To turn from the
most noteworthy of modern poetry to the verse in which 'Gwen'
is written is like turning from a brilliant painting to a fine statue. We are scarcely sensible of want of colour, so refreshed are we by purity of outline. All, indeed, is graceful, good, and poetical
work, as pure and limpid in flow as a brook."&mdash;<i>Sunday Times</i>,
February 2nd, 1879.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The piece as a whole will repay very attentive perusal, while
here and there in it there is a particular choice bit of work.
Here, for example, is a fine lyric ... and here a love-song of
rare and exquisite beauty."&mdash;<i>New York Evening Post</i>, February
20th, 1879.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11a" id="Page_11a">11</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Few among the later poets of our time have received such
a generous welcome as the author. He has been appreciated
not by critics alone, but by the general public.... The charm
of 'Gwen' is to be found in the limpid clearness of the versification,
in the pathetic notes which tell the old story of true love
wounded and crushed. Nothing can be more artistically appropriate
or more daintily melodious than the following...."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, October 8th, 1879.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The poem is, as a whole, tender, simple, chaste in feeling,
and occasionally it rises to a lyrical loftiness of sentiment or
grows compact with vigorous thought."&mdash;<i>New York "Nation"</i>,
March 27th, 1879.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The writer has gained inspiration from themes which
inspired Dante; he has sung sweet songs and musical lyrics;
and whether writing in rhyme or blank verse, has proved himself
a master of his instrument. He knows, like all true poets,
how to transmute what may be called common into the pure
gold of poetry."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, July 26th, 1879.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<h3>THE ODE OF LIFE.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">"The 'Ode of Life' ought to be the most popular of all the
author's works. People flock to hear great preachers, but in this
book they will hear a voice more eloquent than theirs, dealing
with the most important subjects that can ever occupy the
thoughts of man."&mdash;<i>Westminster Review</i>, July, 1880.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The many who have found what seemed to them of value
and of use in the previous writings of the author, may confidently
turn to this, his latest and, in his own view, his most mature
work. It is full of beauty of thought, feeling, and language."&mdash;<i>Daily News</i>, April 8th, 1880.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12a" id="Page_12a">12</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Full of exquisite taste, tender colour, and delicate fancy,
these poems will add considerably to the reputation of their
author."&mdash;<i>Sunday Times</i>, April 25th, 1880.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The author is one of the few real poets now living. Anything
at once more sympathetic and powerful it would be
difficult to find in the poetry of the present day."&mdash;<i>Scotsman</i>, May 11th, 1880.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Next to the 'Epic of Hades,' it is his best work."&mdash;<i>Cambridge
Review</i>, May 19th, 1880.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Here is one standing high in power and in fame who has
chosen a nobler course.... The experiment is successful, and
though we must not now discuss the laws to which the structure
of an ode should conform, we rank the poem in this respect
as standing far above Dryden's celebrated composition, but
below the Odes of Wordsworth on Immortality and of Milton
on the Nativity, which still remain peerless and without a
rival."&mdash;<i>Congregationalist</i>, May 1st, 1880.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"A high devout purpose and wide human sympathy ennoble
all the writer's work, and his clear language and quiet music
will retain his audience."&mdash;<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, August, 1880.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In all that respects technical points, certainly the most
finished work we have yet had from the author's hand, and here
and there the phrasing is exquisite. For ambitious aims, and
for art which so far has justified those aims, for elevation and
refinement, these poems are in advance of any of the author's
former works."&mdash;<i>British Quarterly Review</i>, July, 1880.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Any notice of recent poetry would be inadequate without a
reference to the 'Ode of Life.' The only fault we have to find
with this really remarkable effort&mdash;a sort of expansion of Wordsworth's
famous Ode&mdash;is that it is rather too long for its ideas;
but it possesses power, sweetness, occasional profundity, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13a" id="Page_13a">13</a></span>

unmistakable music. It is, when all is said and done, a true
'Ode,' sweeping the reader along as the ode should do, and</p>

<p class="center">'Growing like Atlas, stronger for its load.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">It appears to us to bring definite proof that the writer's pretensions have not been over-stated."&mdash;<i>Contemporary Review</i>,
February, 1881.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<h3>SONGS UNSUNG.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">"Some of the more important pieces make almost equal and
very high demands alike on my sympathy and my admiration,
and I hope you may long be enabled to cherish the enviable gift
of finding utterance for Truths so deep in forms of so much power
and beauty."&mdash;<i>Letter from</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. Gladstone</span>, November, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The reader of his former work will probably commence
this volume with considerable expectations. Nor will he be
altogether disappointed, although he will probably wish that
Mr. Morris had given the world more of his exquisite classical
workmanship."&mdash;<i>Fortnightly Review</i>, November, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"'The New Creed' is, in some respects, his most striking
achievement. The poem is one well suited to his mind, but
we are not aware that he has ever before written anything
at once so impressive, so solemn, and so self-restrained. The
last two lines have all the happy energy of the highest poetry."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, November 10th, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In reading it one feels constantly 'How worthy this book
would be of beautiful illustrations!'"&mdash;<i>Academy</i>, November
24th, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The volume is full of the sweet fruits of a large experience;
a profound study of the many problems of life; a clear insight

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14a" id="Page_14a">14</a></span>

into human nature; and the book as a whole ranks among the
best gifts which the press has in recent years bestowed upon
us."&mdash;<i>Leeds Mercury</i>, November 21st, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"There is not one of these 'Songs Unsung' which does not
deserve to be read and re-read."&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald</i>, November
16th, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In Mr. Morris's new volume we recognize the old qualities
which are so dear to his wide circle of admirers."&mdash;<i>Daily News</i>, December 4th, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"We may safely predict as warm a welcome for the new
volume as has been accorded to its predecessors."&mdash;<i>Ecclesiastical
Gazette</i>, November 15th, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Those who have followed Mr. Morris's career will be pleased
to find that his poetic grasp, his argumentative subtlety, his
tenderness of sympathetic observation, his manly earnestness,
are as conspicuous and impressive as before."&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Mr. Bayne</span>, <i>in
the Helensburgh Times</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The reputation earned by the author's books has been such
as few men in a century are permitted to enjoy. Beginning
with the first volume, it has gone on increasing."&mdash;<i>Liverpool
Mercury</i>, November 9th, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"For ourselves we dare hardly say how high we rank Mr.
Morris. This last volume is deserving of highest praise. In
some of its contents no living poet, to our mind can surpass
him."&mdash;<i>Oxford University Herald</i>, March 8th, 1884.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The gems of this volume, to our mind, are some of the
shorter poems, which are full of melody and colour, saturated with
lyrical feeling, and marked by that simplicity without which no
poem of this class can be called great."&mdash;<i>British Quarterly
Review</i>, January, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15a" id="Page_15a">15</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"The writer is never diffuse or vague or pointless, both his
road and the end of it are always in view."&mdash;<i>New York Critic</i>,
January 19th, 1884.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In one sense 'Songs Unsung' is more typical of Mr. Morris's
genius than any of his previous works. There is in them the
same purity of expression, the same delicate fancy, the same
mastery of technique, and withal the same loftiness of conception."&mdash;<i>Scotsman</i>, December 22nd, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In some respects we must award him the distinction of having
a clearer perception of the springs of nineteenth-century
existence than any of his contemporaries.... What could be
more magnificent than the following conception of the beginning
of things...."&mdash;<i>Whitehall Review</i>, October, 1883.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Mr. Morris has always that picturesque power which limns
in a few words a suggestive and alluring picture of nature or of
life evoking the imagination of the reader to supplement the
clear and vigorous work of the poet."&mdash;<i>New York Christian Union</i>, February, 1884.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"No lover of poetry will fail to make himself possessed of this
volume from the pen of one who has made for himself so
high and distinctive a place among modern writers."&mdash;<i>Manchester
Examiner</i>, January 31st, 1884.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"After making every possible deduction, 'Songs Unsung' is a
noble volume, and ought to be received by those who, like ourselves,
believe in the necessary subordination of art to morality
with profound gratification."&mdash;<i>Freeman</i>, April 18th, 1884.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"We have quoted enough to show that this book has genuine
merit in it, merit in poetry, merit in philosophy, and, we may
add, merit in religion. Lewis Morris takes the 'new and deeper
view of the world' of which Carlyle now and then caught sunny
glimpses. He sings in sweet and measured Tennysonian strains
of philosophy what Darwin and Herbert Spencer teach in prose;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16a" id="Page_16a">16</a></span>

without the informing glow of the imagination. There are
living poets greater than Lewis Morris, but of the younger race
of poets he is foremost."&mdash;<i>The Inquirer</i>, April 5th, 1884.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The hold which a poet who writes with such intense seriousness
of purpose and such passionate earnestness gains upon his
generation is far stronger and more lasting than if his sole
attempt were to stimulate or to satisfy the sense of the beautiful.
All the things of which we wish that poetry should speak to us,
have voice given to them in the song of this glorious singer."&mdash;<i>South Australian Advertiser</i>, March 24th, 1884.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"As a whole this volume, while charming anew the poet's
former admirers, should win for his genius a wider acquaintance
and appreciation."&mdash;<i>Boston Literary World</i>, February 23rd,
1884.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Mr. Morris has the invaluable gift of recognizing and being
in full sympathy with the current ideas and feelings of the time.
The broad humanitarianism, the genuine sympathy with the
sufferings of the poor and unfortunate, characteristic of our age,
is one of the most attractive features of his poetry, and to the
revival of the feeling for classical beauty, which may be looked
upon as a collateral branch of the '&aelig;sthetic' movement, he
owes more than one charming inspiration.... To sum up.
Mr. Morris's volume is likely to add to his reputation. It is
healthy in tone, and shows no decline of the varied qualities to
which the author owes his widespread reputation."&mdash;<i>Times</i>,
June 9, 1884.</p>
